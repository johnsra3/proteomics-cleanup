# proteomics-cleanup
This is an R Code for reading in proteomics data and applying a choice set of headers. 

It is a beta version that is being tested within our group, and any feedback is welcomed.

We are aware of the newer R package readat, which can help read in ADAT files to R, and are comparing our code to the results of this package.
